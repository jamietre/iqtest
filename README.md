### iqtest

A promise-aware testing framework for Javascript

3/12/2012: version 0.1


###### Why would you make YATF (Yet Another Testing Framework)?

iqtest is a unit testing framework that leverages promises to make your life much easier. A promise is something that supports the [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/ "CommonJS") [Promise/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) api. 

Unit testing Javascript is historically a big pain because of the lack of adequate language features to write concise event-handling code.

Some more recent works have improved matters, e.g. [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/ "Mocha"). From the outset, though, I never got into Jasmine or Mocha because I didn't want to learn a new language. Despite the popularity of common-language Javascript constructs, I've found that having to learn a whole new dialect for an application creates more barriers to use than the dialect itself solves. But I would have been willing to do that if that dialect was going to result in concise, expressive code. 

So how can we create async tests with Mocha?

###### Mocha tests

This is how you write an async callback test in Mocha, given a function `getAsync(opts,callback)`:

    it('should respond with the correct value', function(done){
      getAsyncData(opts,function(response) {
         response.should.equal('correct');
         done();
      });

That's a mouthful for not doing very much. Maybe I'm old school but I want a test as simple as this one to be able to be written on one line so I can immediately understand its purpose, yet still be readable. 

In order to be readable on one line, you can't be creating inline closures: 
   
    it('should respond with the correct value', function(done) { getAsyncData
        (opts,function(response) { response.should.equal('correct'); done(); });

It doesn't really fit on one line, and I had to break it at an awkward place to keep it to only two lines. Even something this simple is largely incomprehensible without indenting. And I am not sure what would happen if `wait` failed and in never resolved, either.

###### Buster

Along came <a href="http://busterjs.org/">Buster.JS</a> which provides a robust javascript testing framework that is much more consistent with my old-school ideas about what an assertion should look like (e.g., one line). It has some cool features but it still did not appear to be natively test-aware. It also suffers from the "this will be a baffling ordeal to use if you don't use node.js" syndrome that some interesting Javascript works these days do. Since I write javascript that primarily runs in web browsers, that made it not directly suitable. 

But I found the code and the assertion libraries to be beautiful so I adopted them for this framework. You can drop in "buster-assertions.js" and iqtest will detect and use them. I also learned just enough about CommonJS and Node.js to be dangerous. It is possible this will work with Node, and there's no browser code in the library itself (just in the output handler). If it doesn't work as-is it should be trivial to fix it.

###### A promise to keep it simple

The promise api addresses the whole callback issue with the *promise* object which encapsulates the state of completion. Using promises and a testing framework that is aware of them makes this possible. 

We want to assert that *getAsyncData(opts) responds with the value 'correct'*. You can understand that concept simply. You don't want to think about the fact that it takes some small amount of time for it to return. All you care is that it does, and that the value is right.

iqtest rewrites this test, assuming that our getAsyncData function also returns a promise:

	a.equals('correct',getAsyncData(opts),'should respond with the correct value');

It does exactly the same thing, but it eliminates two closures (e.g. two appearances of the word 'function') and removes all control flow logic from the test.  It also sets a timeout on the promise automatically so the test will fail if it never returns.

If you aren't using promises in your javascript code, start now. You can still use iqtest with callback constructs, though. The code below does not care what `getAsyncData` returns:

    a.areEqual('correct',getAsyncData(opts, a.callback()), 'should respond with the correct value');    // * see note

\* This works by magic. It really doesn't matter what getAsyncData returns.

To be fair we look at using promises in Mocha:

    it('should respond with the correct value', function(done){
      getAsyncData(opts).then(function() {
         response.should.equal('correct');
         done();
      });
    });

About the same, still too many closures and curly braces. And the real value of promises is chaining multiple callbacks, so they would help you more for complex test. But we can't really leverage the promise API cleanly in a test unless the testing framework knows to do something with it.

#### Using it

The framework itself does not require anything other than when.js and timeout.js from [https://github.com/cujojs/when](https://github.com/cujojs/when).

It mostly uses assertions from busterjs.

The example uses a test harness for web browsers that requires jquery. *iqtest itself does not depend on jQuery*. You can run this without jQuery and create your own analysis tool for its output if you like, following the model of the test harness I have provided.

The best way to see how it works is just fire up `iqtest-runner.html` in your browser.

###### Overview


This is all so new, but here's an example. Assume a function called "wait" that returns a promise. 

An example. This is similar to what's in the example here, some tests are designed to fail for illustration purposes.

	iqtest

        // create a new test group. "create" just returns an instance of a TestGroup object from iqtest.
        // the parameters are an ID, and a description. These are purely for your use. The ID may help 
        // you identify the test from a runner.

        .create("sample","A sample test group")

        // "writer" adds an output handler to the test group. writers are added by external code modules that
        // should add their constructor function to "iqtest.writers". See "iqtest-browser-harness.js" for
        // for the format. A test writer should expose an expected API that iqtest will call on certain events.

		.writer("html",$('#output'), {
                showPassed: true
            })

        // "test" creates a new test based on a function. The fuction will be called with two parameters,
        // assert and refute. Each of these exposes the buster.js assertions (plus a few more)

		.test("Test 1",function(a,r) {
		
			a.isTrue(true,"A true value is true")
				.then(function() {
					assert.equals(3,3,"Should fail 3=3");
				}); 
		
			// the 'waitcb' function is a non-promise enabled 'wait'
			// it's second parameter is a callback function. we can
            // let iqtest create one to use for us.

			a.equals(2,wait(2),"Waited 2 secs")
				.equals(3,waitcb(3,assert.callback()),"Waited 3 secs")
				.pass('Got through two chained callbacks');

            // you can pass a function to it to process the response
			// though i don't approve of too many inline functions so 
            // i define the function first. 
			
			var cbHandler = function(response) {
				return response*2;
			};
			a.equals(6,waitcb(3,a.callback(cbHandler)),"Waited 3 secs and multiplied by 2")

			// you can also create a promise to wrap the callback function
			// 'promise' is a member of the iqtest object. iqtest maps
			// a couple members of its api to the global object (window)
            // convenience. you can easily change this if this interferes
            // with the code you're testing

			// promise(func,callback)
            // func gets called with a function that should be passed as the
            // callback

			var p = backpromise(function(cb) {
		    		$('#sample').hide('slow',cb);
		    	}, function(response) {
		   			return "xxx";
		    	});
	
			// now use p just like any promise-returning function		
			
			a.equals(124,p,"Hoping to get 'xxx'");
		
			// use then to explicity wrap code that needs to run inline
            // other than asserts (see "Caveats" below)

			a.then(function() {
				a.isFalse(y,"y is false");
				a.equals(10,glob,"global got set by wait");	
				y=true;
			})
			.then(function() {
				a.equals(true,y,"y is now true");
			})
			.equals(1,1,"Numbers are equal");

            // if you want to do a bunch of assertions that depend on a callback, use "when"			
            // it runs the function passed to it, and returns a promise. If the callback happens
            // to pass a paremeter, it will be passed to the first target of "then"

            a.when(function(cb) {
                $('#sample').hide('slow',cb);
            }).then(function()) {
                a.isFalse($('#sample').is(':visible'));
            });

		})

###### Chaining

The parameter `a` is the `Test` object, and is where you will call your assertions. It's synonymous with `this` but just lets you easily create a short alias for writing assertions. 

This is passed to each test to permit concurrency. If we just created global methods for the assertions, they could not be tied to a particular test, and we could only run one at a time.

You can write chained code to minimize the number of types you will type `a` as shown above. Every assert returns the assert object.

The `Test` object also implements the promise API, `then`. You can use this to explicitly bind code other than asserts to an event.

Every assert is automatically chained to the one before it, whether or not you use the chaining method. It's functionally identical to chain or not chain when calling a method on a single `Test` object. However, things can still run out of order because of asynchronicity....

###### Caveats

There is definitely some trickery needed to make all this possible. This can have unintended consequences if you don't understand how it works. While the goal is to hide the innards of the async processing as much as possible, there are some things that may trip you up. For example:

    var x=0;

    assert.equals(3,wait(3),"Wait returns the parameter it was passed after a time")  // 1st assert: passes
		.equals(0,x,"x is zero");   // 2nd assert: fails!!

    x=2;

	assert.equals(2,x,"x is 2"); // 3rd assert: passes

The first assert starts an async callback. The 2nd assert is `bound to the resolution of the first assert`. By design, and logcally, it will not run until the callback finishes 3 seconds later.

But while things are tied up at city hall for the first two asserts, the code continutes on its merry way and sets `x=2` while we are waiting for assert #1 to finish.

So by the time assert #2 runs, x is quite definitely not equal to zero any more. Assert #3 resolves true, of course.

To avoid this, just assume that everything that is *not an assert* gets run immediately. Because it pretty much does. it's much the same concept as variable hoisting. There's nothing wrong with mixing setup code in with the asserts, but if you are going to write code that depends on something *which can change later in the test* you need to wrap it explicitly. Here's the "corrected" version of this test:

    var x=0;

    a.areEqual(3,wait(3),"Wait returns the parameter it was passed after a time")
	a.areEqual(0,x,"x is zero");
	a.then(function() {
		x=2;
		a.areEqual(2,x,"x is 2"); // 3rd assert: passes
	});
	

Cool eh?

### Reference


    iqtest     

the namespace for this project

		.test(name,testFunc(assert))

create a `TestGroup` and call its test method with these parameters


	TestGroup (returned by iqtest.test)

An object containing one or more Tests

		.test(name,testFunc(assert))

Start a new test in this group asynchronously

		.then(callback,errback,progress)

Promise API for a TestGroup (not implemented yet, will be useful to create code blocks that must run only when a test is completed)

		.then(name,testFunc(assert))

Start a new test that will not run until the previous test finishes (not implemented yet)

		.end(time)

Set a timeout for the testgroup, return a *new* Testgroup (not implemented yet)

	Test

A test object as passed to `TestGroup.test`. You generally don't need to use its api, except if writing a test harness to process the results. Though tests are run with this context, so if you wanted, you could use (e.g.) `this.then` instead of `a.then` (where `a` is the assert object passed to each test run).

		.assert

an `Assert` object, this is passed to the test function as the first parameter

        .refute

a `Refute` object, this is passed to the test function as the 2nd parameter, it is the opposite of assert.

		.then

chain an assert or promise, exposed by `assert.then`

		.backpromise(function(callback),callbackFunction,timeout)

return a promise made from a callback-enabled function. if no timeout is set, defaults to 10 seconds.

        .callback(function)

create a callback that can be used as a callback target in an assert. If no function is passed, it returns true on success. If a function is provided, its return value is evaluated in the assert.

        .when(function(cb))

return a promise that resolves when the function "cb" is executed. That is, this expects "cb" to be used as the callback for an arbitrary async operation (that doesn't natively expose a promise). when will return a promise that resolves when cb is called.

### Project Status

As of 5/15/2012, there are no known bugs in assertion handling and promise dependency resolution. There are certainly some rough edges, particulary when entering "debugging" mode following failed assertions. 

TODO: 

Make a nicer looking web browser output handler.
Write some documentation.
Make an output handler that just logs statistics.
